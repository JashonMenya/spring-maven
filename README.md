### Intro

The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive infrastructure for developing Java applications. It incorporates:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encourages best practices in OOP for robust application development.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principles**: Aims to reduce repetition of software patterns.

### Key Definitions

Understanding some core concepts in Spring:

- **POJO (Plain Old Java Object)**: A simple, ordinary Java object, not bound by any special restriction other than
  those forced by the Java Language Specification.
- **Java Beans**: A class that encapsulates many objects into a single object (the bean). It is serializable, has a
  no-argument constructor, and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods.
- **Spring Beans**: These are POJOs that are managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Spring Beans
  are defined in the application context and provide the backbone of your application.
- **DTO (Data Transfer Object)**: An object that carries data between processes, commonly used to transfer data from a
  database to a client.
- **IoC (Inversion of Control)**:
  - A principle in software engineering where the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a
    container or framework.
  - In Spring, it's achieved through mechanisms like Dependency Injection.
  - The Application Context in Spring wraps the Bean Factory, providing bean configuration and management at runtime.
  - Spring Boot offers autoconfiguration of the Application Context for ease of application development.

### Simplified Definitions with Analogies

- **POJO (Plain Old Java Object)**:

  - Think of a POJO as a plain notebook. It's just a regular notebook without any special rules about how you must
    write in it. Similarly, a POJO is a simple Java object not bound by any special restrictions.

- **Java Beans**:

  - Imagine a toolbox where you can neatly organize tools (like screwdrivers, hammers, etc.) and easily find what you
    need. A Java Bean is like this toolbox - it neatly organizes data in a Java object, and you can use 'getters'
    and 'setters' to access and modify this data, much like opening and closing the toolbox.

- **Spring Beans**:

  - If a Java Bean is a toolbox, a Spring Bean is a toolbox that the Spring Framework keeps track of. The Spring
    Framework knows where this toolbox is and can hand it to you whenever you need it in your project. It's like
    having a helper who knows where all your tools are and brings them to you when needed.

- **DTO (Data Transfer Object)**:

  - Think of a DTO as a delivery package. When you need to send several items from one place to another, you pack them
    into a package. A DTO works similarly in software, bundling data together to transfer it from one part of a system
    to another, like from a database to a user interface.

- **IoC (Inversion of Control)**:
  - Imagine a car factory where the assembly line dictates the order in which a car is built. Inversion of Control is
    like changing this process so that each car part can decide when and how it should be assembled. In Spring, this
    means the framework calls your code instead of you calling the framework's code. This is like having a smart
    assembly line that knows exactly how to assemble the car parts without you directing every step.

### Understanding Annotations in Spring

Annotations in Spring provide a way to configure the behavior of the application and its components through declarative metadata. They are a key part of Spring's programming model.

- **Common Annotations**:
  - `@Component`: Marks a class as a Spring component, indicating it's a candidate for auto-detection when using annotation-based configuration.
  - `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`: Specializations of `@Component` for specific layers in an application (service, persistence, and presentation layers, respectively).
  - `@Autowired`: Enables automatic dependency injection. Tells Spring where and how to inject components.
  - `@RequestMapping`: Used in Spring MVC for mapping web requests to specific handler functions.
  - `@SpringBootApplication`: A convenience annotation that adds all of the following: `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`,
